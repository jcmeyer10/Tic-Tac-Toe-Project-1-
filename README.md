As my first application development project I took a brute force approach to this particular project.  By this I mean I referenced the DOM in the function that has the winning perameters.  If I understand it correctly, it will make connecting it with the API a bit of a hassle.

Problems not solved include being able to click a cell more than once DURING gameplay and not being able to return a TIE.

I used AJAX for the backend and had to refactor some of the code to work with our javascript and worked with Jquery which helped ease us into doing some of the more advanced methods.  We also used HTML and CSS for styling.

Over the length of the course and after I would like to work to refactor it to utilize arrays, and array methods allowed us by jQuery.  This project to me at least was as much about a finished project as seeing how a simple development process might go and how I can do better next time.
