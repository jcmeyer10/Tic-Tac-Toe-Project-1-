As my first application development project I took a brute force approach to this particular project.  By this I mean I referenced the DOM in the function that has the winning perameters.  If I understand it correctly, it will make connecting it with the API a bit of a hassle.

Problems not solved include being able to click the same cell more than once, changing it's value.  It proved, as did the other cells that the player turn switching worked properly but could not figure out how to turn it off.  Any suggestions on that would be appreciated.

Over the length of the course and after I would like to work to refactor it to utilize arrays, and array methods allowed us by jQuery.  This project to me at least was as much about a finished project as seeing how a simple development process might go and how I can do better next time.
