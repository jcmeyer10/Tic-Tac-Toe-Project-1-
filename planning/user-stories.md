1) As a player I want to be able to select X or O so I can play the game

2) As a player I want to be able to start a new game so I can play more than one game in a session

3) As a player I want to be able to see the plays my opponent so I know what moves I have available and where I should make my next play

4) As a player I want to know who wins so I can either hang my head in shame or bask in the glow of victory

5) As a player I want to be able to know when I am out of moves so I can restart the game after a tie
